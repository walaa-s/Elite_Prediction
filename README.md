# 🎓 Student Completion Predictor

> Can we predict who will finish their program and who will quit?  
> With a little machine learning magic — **yes, we can.**

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This app predicts whether a student will **complete** a training program or **quit**, using their background information, education history, and program attributes.

It uses:
- 🔬 **Machine Learning** (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- 🧠 **Smart features** like age range alignment, employment status, and program difficulty
- ⚠️ **Manual logic override** for extremely unrealistic ages (because age 85 in a beginner bootcamp? Probably not.)

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Training**  
   - The model is trained using real-world student + program data  
   - Special attention is given to age logic using features like:
     - `Age In Range`
     - `Extreme Age`
     - `Gap to Min/Max Age`
   - We used `GridSearchCV` to find the best model from Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree

2. **Prediction App (Streamlit)**  
   - A clean and fast interface  
   - User enters student details  
   - Model returns:
     - ✅ Will Complete  
     - ❌ Will Quit  
     - 🎯 Confidence Score  
   - If the student is way outside the age range → we gently throw shade with a warning
